# Compensation-sampling
This is the codebase for our paper [Compensation Sampling for Improved Convergence in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.0628)

The repository is based on [DDIM](https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim) tuned by [ADM](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) with our compensation sampling approach.

## Installation
We use the same installation as [ADM](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion)
